We need to repeatedly update a Chado schema, with data from an OracleDB. This
is the code for the updater, intended to run via cron. 
The Chado API is okay-isch. Remember when reading the code, that the the main
goal here was runtime.
Run ./mtods.py -h and mtods will tell you how to use it.

Environment:
    POSTGRES_PW     Postgres database password. If not existent, but necessary
                    for the connection you will be prompted for the password.
    ORACLEDB_PW     Oracle database password. Same ^ here.


Configuration:
    trans.conf
    *oracledb translation tables*

Requirements:
    python2.7
    python-gevent
    python-psycopg2

    oracle-instaclient (oracledb library, proprietary, V11.2 or newer)

    cx_Oracle (python library using oracle client libraries)

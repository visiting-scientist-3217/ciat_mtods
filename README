We need to repeatedly update a Chado schema, with data from an OracleDB. This
is the code for the updater, intended to run via cron. 
Run ./mtods.py -h and mtods will tell you how to use it.

Environment:
    POSTGRES_PW     Postgres database password. If not existent, but necessary
                    for the connection you will be prompted for the password.
    ORACLEDB_PW     Oracle database password. Same ^ here.

I think its unlikely that this code will be of much use for anyone else. Though
the Chado API is nice (for our purposes at least).

Configuration:
	trans.conf

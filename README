We need to repeatedly update a Chado schema, with data from an OracleDB. This
is the code for the updater, intended to run via cron. 
Run ./mtods.py -h and mtods will tell you how to use it.

Environment:
    POSTGRES_PW     Postgres database password. If not existent, but necessary
                    for the connection you will be prompted for the password.
    ORACLEDB_PW     Oracle database password. Same ^ here.

I think its unlikely that this code will be of much use for anyone else, as we
needed quite a specific translation from one internal database to another.
But the Chado API is okay-isch.

Configuration:
    trans.conf
    *oracledb translation tables*

Requirements:
    python2.7
    python-gevent
    python-psycopg2
    oracle-xe (oracledb library)
    Oracle-cx (python library using oracle-xe)
